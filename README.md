# CVP_7DTD

7 Days to Die modpack aimed at being **server-side** friendly (and to fix some performance/QoL issues for myself and friends). Save yourself the hassle of guiding your inexperienced friends through installing mods.

***Keep modlet folder names the same. The "z" at the beginning is there to force the CVP mods to the end of the load order to avoid conflicts. Things may not work correctly if you change the names.***

## Installation

1. Go to your server folder and create a "Mods" folder if you don't already have one.
2. Drag and drop the "zCVP" modlets of your choosing into your mods folder.
3. Profit?

*Installation is the same for local games/singleplayer, but instead of a server folder, it's your game folder.*
