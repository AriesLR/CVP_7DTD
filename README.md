# CVP_7DTD
 7 Days to Die modpack aimed at being **server-side** friendly (and to fix some performance/QoL issues for myself and friends). Save the yourself hassle of guiding your inexperienced friends through installing mods.

 Keep modlet folder names the same. The "z" at the beginning is there to force the CVP mods to the end of the load order to avoid conflicts. Things may not work correctly if you change the names.




## CVP_ZombieLoot
Modlet for increasing the drop probablity and lowering the despawn timer of zombie loot bags.

> To edit the drop probability and despawn timer open the Mods folder and go to CVP_ZombieLoot/Config/entityclasses.xml and edit the proper values.



<sub>*This modlet will conflict with anything that modifies the drop chance and despawn timer for zombies (more than likely an overhaul or performance mod).</sub>




## CVP_SkillPoints
Modlet for increasing the skill points earned per level (2 by default).

> To edit the amount of skill points earned open the Mods folder and go to CVP_SkillPoints/Config/progression.xml and edit the proper values.



<sub>*This modlet will conflict with anything that modifies the amount of skill points earned (more than likely an overhaul mod).</sub>




## CVP_ForeverTrader
Modlet that makes the traders open 24/7. Also removes the open/close announcements since they're no longer needed.





<sub>*This modlet will conflict with anything that modifies the length of time that the trader is open.</sub>




## CVP_BetterAirdrops
Modlet for adding better loot to airdrops, they are MUCH more worth your time now.

> To edit the loot go to the Mods folder and go to CVP_BetterAirdrops/Config/loot.xml and edit/add the proper values.



<sub>*This modlet will conflict with anything that modifies airdrops.</sub>




## CVP_ModSlots
Modlet for linking mod slots with weapon/armor tier.





<sub>*This modlet will conflict with anything that modifies mod slots.</sub>




## CVP_FasterVehicles
Modlet for increasing the speed (or maxVelocity to be specific) on all vehicles. 

> To edit the loot go to the Mods folder and go to CVP_FasterVehicles/Config/vehicles.xml and edit/add the proper values.



<sub>*This modlet will conflict with anything that modifies vehicles speed.</sub>




## CVP_SilencerUnlocker
Modlet for unlocking the silencer to be crafted immediately, as long as you have a workbench. 

> You could add other items to this if you'd like as long as you know the proper names.



<sub>*This modlet shouldn't conflict with anything.</sub>
